# Website Links Scraper
This is a Python application that scrapes all the available links on a web page and returns them. It uses the modules requests, bs4 and html5lib.

# Installation
To run this application, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, you need to install the required modules using pip. Open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following command:
'''python
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the requests, bs4 and html5lib modules.

# Usage
To run the application, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the scraper.py file is located. Then run the following command:

'''python
python scraper.py <url>

Replace <url> with the URL of the web page you want to scrape. For example:

'''python
python scraper.py https://www.example.com

The application will then scrape all the available links on the web page and print them to the console.
